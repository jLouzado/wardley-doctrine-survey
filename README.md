# wardley-doctrine-survey

Spec for a Survey to evaluate a Company according to the Wardley Doctrine.

- While trying to tweak a survey I found Google Forms didn't have versioning and diff-ing so it was really hard to get feedback.
- Hopefully this makes it easier to refine the questions and the options so it can be a base for better tooling around collecting this data.
